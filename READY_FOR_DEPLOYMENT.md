## 👈 What I Need From You

### Just One Thing: Your GitHub OAuth Client ID

That's it! Once you provide this, I can automate everything else.

---

## 📋 Your 5-Minute Action Items

### Step 1: Create GitHub OAuth App (5 min)

**Go here**: https://github.com/settings/developers

**Click**: OAuth Apps → New OAuth App

**Fill in**:
```
Application name:           Secrets Portal
Homepage URL:               https://trancendos.github.io/secrets-portal
Application description:    Zero-cost GitHub Secrets Management Portal
Authorization callback URL: https://trancendos.github.io/secrets-portal/callback
```

**Click**: Register application

**You'll see**: Client ID (something like `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0`)

---

### Step 2: Copy Your Client ID

You'll see a page showing:

```
Client ID
a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0
```

**Copy the entire value** (the long string of letters/numbers)

---

### Step 3: Give It To Me

**Reply with**: Your Client ID

**Example response**:
```
My Client ID: a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0
```

---

## 🤖 What I'll Do Automatically

Once you give me your Client ID, I will:

- ✅ Add REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID secret
- ✅ Add REACT_APP_GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI secret
- ✅ Verify secrets are set correctly
- ✅ Enable GitHub Actions (if needed)
- ✅ Trigger deployment workflow
- ✅ Monitor deployment progress
- ✅ Verify portal goes live
- ✅ Test OAuth login
- ✅ Create initial test secret
- ✅ Confirm everything is working

**Total time**: ~3 minutes (automatic)

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before giving me your Client ID:

- [ ] I'm logged into GitHub
- [ ] I can see OAuth Apps at https://github.com/settings/developers
- [ ] I created a new OAuth app
- [ ] I filled in all fields correctly
- [ ] I see the Client ID on the page
- [ ] I copied the Client ID

## 🔗 Your OAuth App Page

After creating the app, you'll see a page with:

```
✅ Client ID (this is what you copy)
🔑 Client Secret (don't share this)
📋 Applications settings
⚙️ Configuration details
```

**Look for**: The "Client ID" section
**Copy**: The entire value
**Give to me**: The value

---

## 👋 Easy Troubleshooting

### "I can't find OAuth Apps"

**Go here directly**:
```
https://github.com/settings/developers
```

Or:
1. GitHub.com → Click profile (top right)
2. Settings
3. Developer settings (scroll down left sidebar)
4. OAuth Apps

### "I don't see 'New OAuth App' button"

It might say "Register a new application" instead.
Click that button.

### "The callback URL is confusing me"

Copy and paste this EXACTLY:
```
https://trancendos.github.io/secrets-portal/callback
```

Don't add or remove anything.

## 🚀 Ready?

### Your Next Action

1. Open: https://github.com/settings/developers

- Client Secret is sensitive (don't share)
- Once deployed, users never see these

### Multiple Apps
- You can have up to 100 OAuth apps
- This is your first for this portal
- Easy to delete later if needed

### Testing
- I'll test OAuth login after deployment
- You can revoke app later if needed
- No impact to other projects
